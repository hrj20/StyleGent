# StyleGent

StyleGent is a subscription-based based user profiling service. The basic idea of StyleGent is to develop an online system to serve a monthly box of custom men’s clothing and accessories. This product is addressed to 2 communities of buyers, first, those who are lethargic enough to use the conventional e-commerce websites and second, for those who are not well accustomed and familiar with the latest fashions or trends in the men’s apparel industry. Thus, we rescue such buyers by providing them their preferred clothes and/or accessories in a customized box based on their subscription.

Steps:
1.	A very detailed homepage which shows the product and the steps involved.
2.	Registration step.
3.	Enter DNA (personal details and preferences).
4.	Select preferred subscription.
5.	Enter delivery address.
6.	Enter payment details.
7.	Orders are displayed on the user page.
8.	User can place new order from user page.

Note: 
The system shall operate on a server running the current corporate approved versions of PHP MyAdmin(4.6.3) and supports responsive views in all devices and browsers.
